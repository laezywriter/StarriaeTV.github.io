                <p>We‚Äôve gathered our best tips for promoting your music independently to reach more fans.</p>
                <p>If you aspire to make a profitable career in music. After putting hours into composing, recording, and mastering a song, you should put the same energy and effort into promoting that track. It's important to remember that making music has become increasingly easier, opening up the doors to anyone who can afford the basic equipment and is willing to invest their time into developing their craft. What will really differentiate you from other artists who might even have a similar sound to you, is your marketing approach.</p>
                <p>All of your favorite musicians have put a lot of thought into how they push their music or they have a dedicated team extended by their label that helps widen their fanbase as their catalog grows. If you're an independent artist without any marketing support from a label and you're looking for ideas to help you promote your upcoming single, we got you.</p>
                <p>We get several questions monthly from artists around the lines of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Where can I promote my music for free?</li>
                    <li>How can a beginner promote their music?</li>
                    <li>What are the best ways to promote my music?</li>
                    <li>How can I promote my music and get paid?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Due to popular demand, we‚Äôve put together our best five tips to help you get ahead with promoting your music to reach more potential fans.¬†üìà</p>
                <ol>
                    <strong><li><h3>Share your music with a Pre-save link</h3></li></strong>
                    <p>Pre-save links are a key part of any new music campaign. They let your fans ‚Äúpre-save‚Äù your upcoming release on music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.</p>
                    <p>When a fan clicks on your pre-save link, they‚Äôre taken to a page that lets them ‚Äúpre-save‚Äù your upcoming release. On release day your track will automatically be saved and available in their music library.</p>
                    <p>When your release is live in stores, the pre-save link will automatically convert to a live link so you can continue sharing your new music with your fans!</p><br>
                    <p>Pre-save links are only available for Spotify and Apple Music </p><br>
                    <p>Please note: If you plan to promote your new music ahead of release day with a pre-save campaign, make sure to choose a release date a few days ahead of time. Spotify and Apple Music need some time to process your release in order to generate a pre-save link.</p>
                    <strong><li><h3>Create & post quality content</h3></li></strong>
                    <p>If you‚Äôre not utilizing social media to promote your music already, this is your sign to start! It‚Äôs a great way to build your audience and promote your music (for free).</p>
                    <p>Here are some quick tips:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a strategy: Don‚Äôt just wing it. Come up with a marketing plan for your upcoming release, ahead of time. Think of a theme that ties in with your release that can be visually communicated online. Make streamlined content that excites your audience about your upcoming drop and create a story around it.</li>
                        <li>Find which platforms work best for you: Being active on every social media platform is a challenge and simply put, too time-consuming. Pick between Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. Read up on the platforms and allocate time each week to plan out content. <a href="https://later.com/blog/">Later</a> has many helpful articles and videos breaking down tips for each platform. Do your research and pick your best fit.</li>
                        <li>Be consistent: Post often, but not too often. We all know those people that clutter our feeds with a post every single day: don‚Äôt be that person. Just be consistent (moderately).
                            <br>
                            For Example
                            <br>
                            Twitter: 1-4 times per week<br>
                            Facebook: 4-7 times per week<br>
                            Instagram: 1-3 times per week<br>
                            TikTok: 6-10 times per week<br>
                            (while you get started, then go down to 3-6)
                        </li>
                        <li>Be authentic: The most valuable thing with social media is being able to connect in real-time with your audience. To really create relatability and connect with your fans, make sure you‚Äôre being your authentic self. We all have different sides to our personalities and assets that make us, us. Find a way to be yourself, even if that means your artist persona, you can still be yourself. Don‚Äôt listen to the noise going on around you and what other artists are doing online, get to know what makes you unique and let that shine.</li>
                        <li>Keep your branding consistent: Be consistent with your image! Once you figure out what you can bring to the (online) table and what your vibe is, stick to it. Keep your branding consistent across the social media platforms you are active on and make sure you have the same or a similar handle (name) on all your accounts.</li>
                        <li>Connect with your audience: Don‚Äôt just post and ghost. Interact with your audience. When they comment, DM, or try to connect with you somehow: respond! This is a great way to build your stans, and showcase your personality straight in response to those that will help you reach the top. For example, launch a competition on Instagram asking your fans to submit their photos or art for their chance of their artwork being featured as the official artwork on your next release. Get creative, engage with your fans and start building your communiuty</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong><li><h3>Create a successful EPK</h3></li></strong>
                    <p>Whether you‚Äôre sending your track to blogs or hitting up playlist curators, having a strong EPK (Electronic Press Kit) in the form of a one-pager or website, will help playlist curators, promoters, and booking agents take you seriously.<br>
                        An EPK should include links to your music, imagery, touring history (or live shows), audience data, and social statistics.<br>
